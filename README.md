# Scala Koans
Koans are small lessons on the path to enlightenment. The aim of the Scala Koans project is to provide an easy learning environment in Scala. Your insight will be derived by encountering failing tests and fixing them so that they pass. A testing framework is used to simplify this process and to get you off to a good start with using Scala.

This project is based on the many versions of ScalaKoans I have found. I wanted to bring this up to current (2.12.x) standards so others can benefit from this. I am no way affiliated with the original authors. Please see [ScalaKoans.org](https://www.scalakoans.org) for more info.

## Requirements
sbt or an IDE to run the Koans test class

## Usage
